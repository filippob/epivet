Mixed scripts and functions for veterinary epidemiology

This repository is meant to gather code and example to be used in veterinary epidemiology.
The starting example is a work in dairy cow feet and legs disorders.

Topics covered include:
- calculation of time-at-risk ("cow-years")
- estimation of prevalence and incidence
- comparison of different diagnostic approaches

### operative guidelines

1. `get_at_risk_population.r`: script to subset the data based on the selected year of reference
